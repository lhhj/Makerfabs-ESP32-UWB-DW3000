## üéØ What Problem Does This Solve?

**Problem**: K4W tags need a BLE "connect" signal before they'll transmit UWB ranging data. You don't know what signal to send.

**Solution**: The discovery tool:
1. Scans for K4W tags via BLE
2. Connects and enumerates ALL services/characteristics
3. Subscribes to notifications to catch responses
4. Systematically sends test payloads to every writable characteristic
5. Monitors the UWB radio after each write
6. **Tells you exactly which command triggered UWB transmission**

---

## üìä Expected Results

When successful, you'll see output like:

```
‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê
‚ïë ‚ö° POTENTIAL MATCH DETECTED!
‚ïë Characteristic: 0000fff1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
‚ïë Payload: 0x01 0x00 (enable with param)
‚ïë UWB Packets received: 3
‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê
```

This tells you:
- **Which BLE characteristic** to write to
- **What bytes to send** (`0x01 0x00`)
- **Confirmation** that UWB packets were received

---

## üîß Configuration

Edit these in `k4w_ble_discovery.ino` if needed:

```cpp
// Line 12-14: Scan settings
static const char* TARGET_NAME_HINT = "K4W";  // Change if tag has different name
static const char* TARGET_ADDR = "";          // Set MAC if you know it

// Line 17-18: Timing
static const uint16_t WAIT_AFTER_WRITE_MS = 2000;     // How long to wait for UWB
static const uint16_t WAIT_AFTER_SUBSCRIBE_MS = 1000; // Notification settling time

// Line 21-24: UWB pins (should match your hardware)
static const uint8_t UWB_PIN_RST = 27;
static const uint8_t UWB_PIN_IRQ = 34;
static const uint8_t UWB_PIN_SS  = 4;
```

---

## üß™ What Payloads Are Tested?

The tool tests 19 different payloads:

### Binary Commands (10)
- Single bytes: `0x01`, `0xFF`
- Two bytes: `0x01 0x00`, `0x01 0x01`, `0x00 0x01`, `0xA5 0x5A`, `0x55 0xAA`, `0xAA 0x55`
- Four bytes: `0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00`, `0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01`

### ASCII Commands (9)
- `START`, `BEGIN`, `ENABLE`, `UWB`, `ON`, `RUN`, `GO`, `INIT`, `CONNECT`

Each is tested on **every writable characteristic** found on the tag.

---

## üíæ Output Logging

Use `monitor.ps1` to automatically save logs:
- Creates timestamped file: `k4w_discovery_log_20231021_143022.txt`
- Captures all serial output
- Useful for later analysis

Or manually redirect:
```powershell
arduino-cli monitor -p COM3 -c baudrate=115200 | Tee-Object -FilePath log.txt
```

## üîç Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| **Tag not found** | Check battery, try "KBeacon" or "KKM" as TARGET_NAME_HINT |
| **Connection fails** | Move closer, remove interference, try pairing first |
| **No UWB packets** | Check antenna, verify channel 5, ensure UWB init succeeded |
| **Upload fails** | Close other programs using COM port, try BOOT button |
| **Compile errors** | Install ESP32 core: `arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32` |

See **QUICKSTART.md** for detailed troubleshooting.

## ü§ù Contributing / Sharing

If you successfully discover the K4W command:

1. **Document it clearly**:
   ```
   Service UUID: 0000fff0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
   Characteristic UUID: 0000fff1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
   Command: 0x01 0x00
   Result: Tag begins transmitting UWB beacon every ~100ms
   ```

2. **Test with multiple tags** (if possible)

3. **Share with the community**:
   - Create a GitHub issue/PR
   - Post in Makerfabs forums
   - Update this README

4. **Create a minimal example**:
   ```cpp
   // Working K4W UWB Enable Command
   // Discovered: [Your Name], [Date]
   
   NimBLEClient* client = NimBLEDevice::createClient();
   client->connect(NimBLEAddress(tagAddress));
   
   NimBLERemoteService* svc = client->getService("0000fff0-...");
   NimBLERemoteCharacteristic* ch = svc->getCharacteristic("0000fff1-...");
   
   uint8_t enableCmd[] = {0x01, 0x00};
   ch->writeValue(enableCmd, 2, true);
   
   // Tag now transmits UWB!
   ```

## üìù Notes

- Discovery process takes 5-10 minutes per tag
- Tool is conservative: 2-second wait between tests
- UWB must initialize successfully (watch for "‚úì Passive RX started")
- Some tags may require pairing/bonding before commands work
- Multi-step sequences not yet automated (see manual methods in guide)
